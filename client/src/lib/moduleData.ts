          <p>Ever wonder why you instantly click with some people yet butt heads with others?</p><p>Turns out there's a scientific reason that has to do with how our brain is wired.</p><p>Brain behavior preferences influence things like our strengths, communication style and even what we find stressful.</p><p>According to brain-based models, there are four engagement profiles or preferences.</p><p>As we go through the course, take some notes on how these might relate to you.</p><p>These will give you insight into your inherent strengths that can make you a better team player. Here they are.</p>
          <p><img src='images/module2/engagement_styles.png' alt='The four engagement styles: Goal-driven, Task-driven, Vision-driven, and People-driven' style='width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:20px auto;'></p>
          <p>We have goal-driven, task-driven, vision-driven and people-driven engagement. Typically, we prefer one or two of these.</p><p>This explains why we click with certain people because we share the same preferences.</p>
          <p>A goal-driven preference reflects an analytical approach, a focus on facts and figures, on identifying goals and prioritizing efficiency.</p><p>You naturally analyze data and like to seek trends.</p><p>Now, if you are usually early to meetings, like to follow an agenda, love your to-do lists and enjoy planning meticulously, you might be task driven.</p><p>You'll find yourself more interested in what's happening in the present.</p><p>Are processes being followed, quality control and compliance.</p><p>You like establishing order, maybe you're vision driven, where you enjoy driving change and taking risks, experimenting and thinking outside the box in your work.</p><p>And you might catch yourself thinking about the future and about how things fit into the big picture.</p><p>Or you might be just like me a people-driven relationship builder.</p><p>You're team-oriented, communication focused and genuinely care about making sure everyone feels valued and respected.</p><p>Thinking things like who's been impacted and how, before taking steps to solve it.</p><p>So which of the four engagement styles feels most like you?</p><p>Remember, we're talking about how you prefer to engage with your team, not your capabilities.</p><p>Download the exercise file to dig in a little more.</p><p>Then find ways to leverage your strengths with your team.</p><p>Maybe volunteer for a new project where your preference sets you up for success or partner with someone whose strengths compliment yours.</p>

        <p>Where will our growth come from in the next five years?</p><p>How could we respond to the threat presented by potentially disruptive competitors?</p><p>Ask why.</p><p>Develop a habit of often asking yourself why am I doing this?</p><p>This reminds you of the big picture, and aligns your decision making with the team and company goals.</p><p>Consider alternatives using inversion.</p><p>If you're solving a problem think about the worst case scenario really.</p><p>For example you explore all the potential risks and concerns, including if this was to fail what could have caused the failure?</p><p>If we ran out of resources, what would we do?</p><p>By considering weaknesses in advance you're better able to prepare for and mitigate them before they arise.</p><p>Identifying gaps, address these four priority areas.</p><p>Vision, how does this fit in with the big picture.</p><p>Goal, what are the facts and what's the immediate objective?</p><p>People, who is impacted, and how have we engaged them and how do they feel about this.</p><p>Task, what needs to be done to make this happen?</p><p>Conduct a post-mortem.</p><p>In the world of management, a post-mortem is a post-implementation review.</p><p>Once you finished a project reflect on what went well and what didn't.</p><p>What could be better next time?</p><p>What were the gaps?</p><p>What do you wish you knew when you started?</p><p>You can even take this a step further and do this with your team.</p><p>Doing these regularly helps to build a habit of strategic thinking and the more you do it, the better you get.</p>`,

        <p>How you show up when you're with your team matters more than you realize.</p>
        <p class="mt-2">Solution orientation is a critical skill that encourages everyone in the team to work together towards finding solutions rather than just pointing out problems. Here are three tips to cultivate your solution orientation.</p>
        <img src="images/module6/solution_orientation_src.png" alt="Solution Orientation diagram showing three key components: Language Reframing, Collective Curiosity, and Offer Solutions" style="width:100%; max-width:600px; display:block; margin:20px auto;" />
        <ul class="list-disc ml-5">
        <li><p>Language reframing.</p><p>This is a technique that involves changing the way that we talk about a problem to make it more amenable to solutions.</p><p>For example, reframe problem to opportunity.</p><p>Let's say your company is facing financial difficulties.</p><p>Rather than saying, \"We are in financial trouble and don't know what to do,\" you could say, \"We see this as an opportunity to reevaluate our business model and find new ways to increase revenue and cut costs, improving our financial health in the long run.\"</p><p>This way, you're more open-minded to creative solutions and can emerge from the situation even stronger than before.</p><p>Another example is reframing failure to learning experience.</p><p>Let's say you perform poorly in a client pitch.</p><p>Rather than saying, \"I can't believe this happened.</p><p>I failed,\" reframe to, \"I see this as a learning experience.</p><p>I'll prepare better and get feedback so I do better with the next pitch.\"</p><p>This way, you're more proactive, rather than feeling defeated.</p><p>These simple shifts in language can have a profound effect on how we approach the problem, encouraging us to think more positively and creatively.</p></li>
        <li><p>Collective curiosity.</p><p>A true solution orientation requires you to ask curious questions to the root of the issue and to think more creatively.</p><p>By asking how questions, teams can begin to explore different approaches and creative solutions.</p><p>For example, if a team is struggling with sticking to budget, they might ask questions like, how can we reduce costs without sacrificing quality?</p><p>Or how can we use existing resources more efficiently?</p>
        <li><p>Offer solutions.</p><p>Rather than just complaining about a problem or a task, brainstorm at least three potential solutions along with pros and cons.</p><p>This not only helps you develop a skill called cognitive flexibility, it also helps the team move forward faster and makes it easier to identify what solution's going to work best.</p>
        </ul>
        <br/>
        <p>By incorporating solution orientation into your day-to-day thinking, you can become an invaluable asset to any team.</p><p>Not only will you be able to identify problems and offer solutions, but you'll also encourage the team to work together towards finding the best solution.</p><p>This can help create a more collaborative environment that leads to better results.</p><p>You'll find reflection questions and a summary in the exercise files, along with space to make your own commitments.</p>`,
