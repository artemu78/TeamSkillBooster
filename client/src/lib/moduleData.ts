  <div class="space-y-4 mb-8 text-lg">
    <p class="font-medium text-xl text-indigo-700">Ever wonder why you instantly click with some people yet butt heads with others?</p>
    <p>Turns out there's a scientific reason that has to do with how our brain is wired.</p>
    <p>Brain behavior preferences influence things like our strengths, communication style and even what we find stressful.</p>
    <p>According to brain-based models, there are <span class="font-semibold">four engagement profiles or preferences</span>.</p>
    <p>As we go through the course, take some notes on how these might relate to you.</p>
    <p>These will give you insight into your inherent strengths that can make you a better team player. Here they are.</p>

  </div>

  <!-- Engagement Types Overview -->
  <div class="space-y-4 mb-8">
    <p class="text-lg">We have goal-driven, task-driven, vision-driven and people-driven engagement. Typically, we prefer one or two of these.</p>
    <p class="text-lg mb-6">This explains why we click with certain people because we share the same preferences.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- Detailed Descriptions of Engagement Types -->
  <div class="grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6 mb-10">
    <!-- Goal-driven -->
    <div class="bg-blue-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-blue-700 mb-3">Goal-driven</h3>
      <p>A goal-driven preference reflects an analytical approach, a focus on facts and figures, on identifying goals and prioritizing efficiency.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">You naturally analyze data and like to seek trends.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Task-driven -->
    <div class="bg-green-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-green-700 mb-3">Task-driven</h3>
      <p>If you are usually early to meetings, like to follow an agenda, love your to-do lists and enjoy planning meticulously, you might be task driven.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">You'll find yourself more interested in what's happening in the present.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Are processes being followed, quality control and compliance.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Vision-driven -->
    <div class="bg-purple-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-purple-700 mb-3">Vision-driven</h3>
      <p>You like establishing order, maybe you're vision driven, where you enjoy driving change and taking risks, experimenting and thinking outside the box in your work.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">And you might catch yourself thinking about the future and about how things fit into the big picture.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- People-driven -->
    <div class="bg-red-50 p-6 rounded-lg shadow-sm">
      <h3 class="text-xl font-bold text-red-700 mb-3">People-driven</h3>
      <p>Or you might be just like me a people-driven relationship builder.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">You're team-oriented, communication focused and genuinely care about making sure everyone feels valued and respected.</p>
      <p class="mt-2">Thinking things like who's been impacted and how, before taking steps to solve it.</p>

    <p class="mt-2">Then find ways to leverage your strengths with your team.</p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Here are five surprisingly easy ways you can reconfigure your thinking to be more strategic:</p>

  </ul>
  <div class="mb-4">
    <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Ask why.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">Develop a habit of often asking yourself why am I doing this?</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">This reminds you of the big picture, and aligns your decision making with the team and company goals.</p>

  <div class="mb-4">
    <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Consider alternatives using inversion.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">If you're solving a problem think about the worst case scenario really.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">For example you explore all the potential risks and concerns, including if this was to fail what could have caused the failure?</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700">If we ran out of resources, what would we do?</p>

    <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Conduct a post-mortem.</p>
    <p class="text-gray-700 mb-2">In the world of management, a post-mortem is a post-implementation review.</p>

  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-2">How you show up when you're with your team matters more than you realize.</p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-6">Solution orientation is a critical skill that encourages everyone in the team to work together towards finding solutions rather than just pointing out problems. Here are three tips to cultivate your solution orientation.</p>
  <img src="images/module6/solution_orientation_src.png" alt="Solution Orientation diagram showing three key components: Language Reframing, Collective Curiosity, and Offer Solutions" class="w-full max-w-xl mx-auto block rounded-md mb-6" />
  <ul class="list-disc ml-6 text-gray-700">
    <li class="mb-4">
      <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Language reframing.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">This is a technique that involves changing the way that we talk about a problem to make it more amenable to solutions.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">For example, reframe problem to opportunity.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">Let's say your company is facing financial difficulties.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">Rather than saying, "<span class="italic">We are in financial trouble and don't know what to do</span>," you could say, "<span class="italic">We see this as an opportunity to reevaluate our business model and find new ways to increase revenue and cut costs, improving our financial health in the long run.</span>"</p>
      <p class="mb-2">This way, you're more open-minded to creative solutions and can emerge from the situation even stronger than before.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">Another example is reframing failure to learning experience.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">Let's say you perform poorly in a client pitch.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">Rather than saying, "<span class="italic">I can't believe this happened.</span></p>
      <p class="mb-2"><span class="italic">I failed</span>," reframe to, "<span class="italic">I see this as a learning experience.</span></p>
      <p class="mb-2"><span class="italic">I'll prepare better and get feedback so I do better with the next pitch.</span>"</p>
      <p>This way, you're more proactive, rather than feeling defeated.</p>
      <p>These simple shifts in language can have a profound effect on how we approach the problem, encouraging us to think more positively and creatively.</p>
    </li>
    <li class="mb-4">
      <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Collective curiosity.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">A true solution orientation requires you to ask curious questions to the root of the issue and to think more creatively.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">By asking how questions, teams can begin to explore different approaches and creative solutions.</p>
      <p>For example, if a team is struggling with sticking to budget, they might ask questions like, how can we reduce costs without sacrificing quality?</p>
      <p>Or how can we use existing resources more efficiently?</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p class="font-semibold text-gray-800 mb-2">Offer solutions.</p>
      <p class="mb-2">Rather than just complaining about a problem or a task, brainstorm at least three potential solutions along with pros and cons. This not only helps you develop a skill called cognitive flexibility, it also helps the team move forward faster and makes it easier to identify what solution's going to work best.</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <br />
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-2">By incorporating solution orientation into your day-to-day thinking, you can become an invaluable asset to any team.</p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-2">Not only will you be able to identify problems and offer solutions, but you'll also encourage the team to work together towards finding the best solution.</p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700 mb-2">This can help create a more collaborative environment that leads to better results.</p>
  <p class="text-lg text-gray-700">You'll find reflection questions and a summary in the exercise files, along with space to make your own commitments.</p>`,
