📘 Module 1: Know Your Team Style
Introduction:
“Understanding your communication style helps you work more effectively with others. Everyone brings unique strengths to a team.”

Style type

2 strengths

🧠 Module 2: Listen, Connect, Collaborate
Heading: “Great teams start with great listening.”

Key Points (display as cards or callouts):

“Active listening” means giving your full attention — not just waiting to speak.

Tailor your communication to others’ needs and context.

Ask clarifying questions like “What I’m hearing is...” or “Can you tell me more?”

Value different perspectives — even if you disagree.

Mini Scenario Question:
“Your teammate seems upset in a meeting. What do you do?”
Options:

A) Ask them what’s wrong in front of everyone

B) Talk to them privately after

C) Ignore it
✅ Correct answer: B

Interactive Prompt:
Add a reflection field: “Describe a time when better listening could’ve changed the outcome.”

🤝 Module 3: Trust, Conflict & Feedback
Quote:
“Trust is the glue of life. It’s the foundational principle that holds all relationships.” – Stephen Covey

Key Ideas:

Trust is built by being consistent, honest, and showing up.

Conflict can be healthy — it depends on how you handle it.

Avoid blame; focus on actions and behaviors.

Give feedback that’s specific, timely, and constructive.

Receive feedback without being defensive.

Interactive Idea:
Add a drag-and-drop with these actions:

Builds Trust: Meeting deadlines, being honest, giving credit

Breaks Trust: Blaming, withholding info, gossiping

Reflection Prompt:
“What’s one thing you can do this week to build more trust?”
